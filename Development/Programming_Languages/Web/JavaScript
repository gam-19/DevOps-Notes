# JavaScript  

## What is?
* JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used primarily for creating interactive effects within web browsers.  
* It is a core technology for building dynamic web pages and web applications.

## Defs:
Interpreted programming language:  
- Executes code directly without the need for a separate compilation step.   
- The interpreter translates each statement or line into machine code or bytecode on-the-fly and executes it immediately.  
E.g.: Javascript, Python, Ruby, Perl, Bash.

Compiled programming languages:  
 * Require a separate compilation step where the source code is translated into machine code or an intermediate language before execution.  
 E.g.: C, C++, Java, C#, Go, Swift.

    Pro:  
    * Faster execution, better optimization, direct hardware access, and increased control over memory management.  

    Con:  
    * More development time due to the compilation step and platform-specific considerations.
