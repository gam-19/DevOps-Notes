Virtualization type:
HVM (Harware Virtualization Machine)  
* Has a fully virtualized hardware set. Own emulated CPU, memory, etc.
* Potencially slower initially, but can leverage hardware extensions for better performance.  
Note: Modern cloud instances are optimized for HVM, making the preferred choise.

PV (Paravirtualization)
* Modifies the guest OS for better performance.
* Guest OS sees partially virtualized hardware set.
* Faster due to optimized guest OS kenel.
